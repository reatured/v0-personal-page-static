## Project Overview

This cyberpunk character was designed for a futuristic sci-fi game environment. The character features a highly detailed model with intricate cybernetic enhancements, realistic facial features, and a complete set of customizable clothing and accessories. The model was created with game-ready optimization in mind, balancing visual fidelity with performance requirements.

## Process

The creation process began with concept sketches and mood boards to establish the visual direction. After finalizing the design, I created a base mesh in ZBrush, refined the high-poly details, and then retopologized for game use. UV mapping and texturing were done in Substance Painter, followed by rigging and animation setup in Maya.

### Workflow Steps:

1. **Concept Development** - Created multiple design iterations based on client brief
2. **Base Mesh Creation** - Developed the primary forms in ZBrush
3. **High-Poly Sculpting** - Added detailed elements and surface textures
4. **Retopology** - Optimized the mesh for real-time rendering
5. **UV Mapping** - Created efficient texture layouts
6. **Texturing** - Developed PBR materials in Substance Painter
7. **Rigging** - Created a flexible animation skeleton
8. **Animation Testing** - Validated the rig with basic movement sets

## Challenges

The main challenge was creating a character that maintained visual impact while meeting the polygon budget for real-time rendering. Additionally, the complex cybernetic parts required careful planning to ensure they would animate correctly with the character's movements.

The client also requested last-minute design changes to several key cybernetic components, which required careful reworking without disrupting the existing rig and texture sets.

## Solutions

I used normal maps and other texture techniques to preserve detail while keeping the polygon count manageable. For the cybernetic parts, I created a modular system that allowed for efficient reuse of components while maintaining visual variety.

To accommodate the design changes, I developed a non-destructive workflow that allowed for component swapping without requiring complete re-rigging or re-texturing of the character.

## Results

The final character was successfully implemented in the game engine with excellent performance metrics. The client was particularly pleased with the visual fidelity achieved within the technical constraints, and the character has become one of the most recognizable elements in the game's marketing materials.

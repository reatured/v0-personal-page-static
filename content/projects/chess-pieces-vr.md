# Chess Pieces Used in Virtual Reality

## Overview
Implementation of chess pieces in Unity for a VR chess game.

## Process
1. **Modeling**: Created low-poly chess piece models
2. **UV Mapping**: Prepared UVs for texturing
3. **Texturing**: Created materials and textures
4. **Optimization**: Optimized models for VR performance
5. **Unity Integration**: Imported models into Unity
6. **VR Interaction**: Set up VR interaction scripts

## Technical Details
The chess pieces were designed to be visually appealing while maintaining low polygon counts for optimal VR performance. Each piece has collision detection for realistic gameplay and physics interactions.

## Tools Used
- Blender for modeling
- Unity for game implementation
- Oculus SDK for VR integration

# Character Modeling Project

This project focuses on creating detailed 3D character models suitable for animation and games.

## Workflow

1. Concept art and reference gathering
2. Base mesh creation
3. High-poly sculpting in ZBrush
4. Retopology for animation
5. UV unwrapping and texturing
6. Rigging and test animations

The character was designed with a focus on both aesthetic appeal and technical efficiency for animation.

# Architectural Visualization Project

This project showcases modern architectural visualization techniques using Blender and V-Ray.

## Process

1. Initial concept sketching
2. 3D modeling of the structure
3. Material and texture application
4. Lighting setup
5. Rendering and post-processing

The final result demonstrates photorealistic rendering of contemporary architectural designs.

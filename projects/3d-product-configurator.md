# 3D Product Configurator

This project is an interactive 3D product configurator built with Three.js and React Three Fiber. It allows users to customize products in real-time, changing colors, materials, and components.

## Features

- Real-time 3D rendering
- Interactive customization options
- Material and texture swapping
- Camera controls for viewing from different angles
- Screenshot and sharing capabilities

## Technical Details

The configurator uses React Three Fiber as a React wrapper around Three.js. It implements custom shaders for realistic materials and optimizes performance through instancing and texture compression.

The UI is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, with a focus on intuitive controls and responsive design.

# Brand Identity System

A comprehensive brand identity system created for a tech startup. The project included logo design, typography selection, color palette development, and creation of usage guidelines.

## Project Scope

- Logo design (primary, secondary, and icon versions)
- Typography system with primary and secondary fonts
- Color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Brand usage guidelines
- Mockups for various applications (business cards, letterheads, etc.)

## Design Process

The design process began with stakeholder interviews and market research to understand the brand's values, target audience, and competitive landscape. From there, I developed mood boards and concept sketches, refining the direction through multiple iterations based on client feedback.

The final deliverable was a comprehensive brand guide documenting all elements of the identity system and providing clear guidelines for consistent application across all touchpoints.
